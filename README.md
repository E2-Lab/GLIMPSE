# GLIMPSE (Grid Layout Interface for Model Preview and System Exploration)

This visualization is a graph-based web application to visualize and update power grid models. The tool allows to search, highlight power grid objects. Additionally, it also supports update attributes and export updated model to integrate with GridLAB-D for future simulations. The application is developed using react.js, node.js, and python.
